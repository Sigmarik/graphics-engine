# Yet Another GameDev Framework

![screenshot.png](docs/screenshot.png)

## Description

This project is a game development framework with rudimentary physics, graphics and asset management systems.

Its features include, but not limited to:
- [gbuffer-based rendering pipeline](lib/graphics/objects/scene.cpp),
- [flexible asset system](lib/managers/asset_manager.h) with the ability to write [custom importers](lib/graphics/importers/materials.cpp),
- [robust physics engine](lib/physics/level_geometry.h),
- [hierarchical scene organization system](lib/logics/scene.h),
- [simple Blender addon for framework scene format capability](blender),
- [asset-based user input system](lib/input) (soon to be enhanced with an event-driven interface).

WIP (Work In Progress) features:
- [high-level scripting language for sequence programming](https://github.com/Sigmarik/graphics-engine/tree/assets/scene-scripts/lib/logics/blueprints/scripts),
- [support for animated models](https://github.com/Sigmarik/graphics-engine/issues/4),
- [adequate project structure :)](https://github.com/Sigmarik/graphics-engine/issues/26).

## Documentation

As for now, there is none.

Examine template projects, read the interface documentation generated by the `$ make doxy` command (make sure you have doxygen installed), look at the [pull requests](https://github.com/Sigmarik/graphics-engine/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) of features you want to learn about.

## Building the project

The project was tested on *Linux Mint 21.2* OS, but should work on other common linux distributions as well.

### GNU Make

1. Install GNU Make version 4.3 or above,
2. Install assimp version 5.2 or above,
3. Install the GLFW library (manually or by running `$ make install-glfw`),
4. Run `$ make`.

After the build is complete, the executable with all corresponding assets can be found in the [build](build/) folder. It can be ran either manually or by executing `$ make run`.
